# The-usage-of-Popular-AI-Tools
In this project I will give some sample example to each AI Tools I know. The tool may be a DeepLearning Tool such as huggingface transformers, or a NLP Tool such as Stanza or how to use Standford CoreNLP on Google Colab.

All the data in project will be very brief, such as a sentence or a list of sentences. Because it is easy for every coder to make the original data to fit there need, but it is not easy for them to quick understand what data format the tool want.

So this project just want to quick introduce how to use an AI tool.
